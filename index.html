                        i am originally from san francisco, california but have also lived in madison, wisconsin.
                        originally, i had attended uw-madison hoping to be a biomedical engineer but decided that
                        computer science was something that i was more suited for. i am set to graduate this
                        upcoming spring with my bachelor's of art degree in computer science. after graduation,
                        i hope that i will matriculate into a software engineering role at a financial firm. i
                        would also like to further my academic career and attain my mba concentrating in finance.
